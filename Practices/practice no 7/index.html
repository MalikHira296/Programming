    <p>Often, a sentence needs an article before a noun in order to make <br/> grammatical sense. For example,<p>
 <p> <b>❌ Incorrect: </b> I have box. <br/> <b> ✅ Correct:</b> I have a box.</p>
<h3>⚡️Article examples</h3>

<p>In English, there are only three articles. They are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        the
    </li>
    <li>
        a
    </li>
    <li>
        an
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The following sentences show examples of how we use articles <br/> in sentences:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The zoo has an elephant enclosure.
    </li>
    <li>
        I have a younger brother and an older sister.
    </li>
    <li>
        The ancient Romans built the Coliseum.
    </li>
    <li>
        Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
    </li>
</ul>

<p>In English, the only <a href="#">definite  article </a> is the word the. A definite <br/>article has several roles that it performs.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        A definite article is used to refer to unique things or groups. A definite article can indicate that something is unique and only one of it exists.
    </li>

<ul>

    <li>
        She gazed at the moon. (The Earth only has one moon)
    </li>

    <li>
        She gazed at the moon. (The Earth only has one moon)
    </li>
</ul>
<li>
    A definite article is used to refer to specific things that both the speaker and the listener know the identity of.
</li>
<ul>
    <li>
        Harold went to the store. (Both the speaker and the listener know specifically which store Harold went to.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Harold went to the store. (Both the speaker and the listener know specifically which store Harold went to.)
    </li>
</ul>




  
<p>In writing and speech, the word the is typically used after the speaker or writer first introduces a thing that they are talking about. The word the then references back to this same thing. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>
    We saw <u>birds</u>   by the lake. <b> The birds</b> were building nests. (The word the indicates that the birds in the second sentence are the same birds mentioned in the first sentence.)
</li>
</ul>
</ol>
